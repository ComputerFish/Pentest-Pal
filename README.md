# Pentest-Pal

Pentest Pal is a Wi-Fi and network penetration testing platform centered around red team operations with quick deployment and concealment abilities. Here are some images showing Pentest Pal in operation.

This project was a great learning experience. Coming from knowing nothing about networks or Linux, building Pentest Pal forced me to learn what I needed to in order to achieve what I wanted. It has been really useful for understanding the way security is implemented, all the way from the data packets to the receiving host. While the main focus is offensive network testing, it is still a Kali Linux machine at heart! This means it is capable of all sorts of hacking and is infinitely expandable.
