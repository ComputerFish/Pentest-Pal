# Pentest-Pal

Pentest Pal is a WIFI and network penetration testing platform centered around red team ops with quick deployment and concealment abilities. Here are some images with Pentest Pal in operation.

This project was a great learning experience, coming from knowing nothing about networks or Linux for that matter building Pentest Pal forced me to learn what I needed to in order to achive what I wanted. It has been really useful for understanding the way secuirty is implemented all the way from the data packets to the receiving host. While the main focus is offensive network testing it is still a Kali Linux machine at heart! this means it is capable of all sorts of hacking and infinitely expandable.
